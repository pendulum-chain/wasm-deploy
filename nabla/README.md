This folder is experimental and needs to be removed eventually and moved to the Nabla repository.

There are two different configuration files here:

- config.json: here access to the Nabla curve repository is assumed
- \_config_precompiledCurve.json: this can be used if there is no access to the Nabla curve repository and we provide a precompiled version of the curve contract
